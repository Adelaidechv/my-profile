				<h1>Hi, I'm Adélaïde 😃</h1>

				<p> 
					I am currently in my first year in the BBA program of Essec Business school! Thanks to Le Wagon, I am designing my own profile page website, and so far, I have been loving the journey. 🥳 In the link under this, there is a quick presentation of my school, go check it out! 😉

					<h2>Travels ✈️</h2>
					<p>
						I had the amazing opportunity of growing up in a family that loves to travel. Ever since I was a little girl, I have been lucky enough to discover new countries, new landscapes, and new cultures through the amazing encounters I had. Next year, I will pursue this dream of discovering the world by studying in the Singapour Essec campus!!

				<h2>Music 🎶</h2>
				<p>
					I listen to music every day, from all sorts of artists and years !! Currently, My favourite artist is Shawn Mendes, and my favourite group is Coldplay. In fact, I am going to see them in Lyon in June! Other than that, I love listening to ABBA, U2, Harry Styles, Elton John, Justin Timberlake...

				<h2>Cooking 👩‍🍳</h2>
				<p>
					I have loved cooking ever since I can remember. Now that I live on my own, it has become a great hobby of mine. When cooking, for myself, or for others; I try to be more conscious of my consumption. Therefore, I mainly cook with fresh products, from local productors. And most importantly, I have fun discovering and creating new recipies !
